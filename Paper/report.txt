We realise that the contrast between our work and that by others was
not emphasised enough in the previous version of our paper.  This was
partly an oversight, and we thank the referee for raising this
important point.  To address it, we have now added text in Section 1
(Introducton) of our paper describing previous work on jet precession
and contrasting our model with previous ones.

The essential idea is that when BH mass is large enough and the BH
binary separation is small enough the time scale over which the binary
evolves is approximately equal to its orbital period.  When this
happens, it becomes impotant to understand the deviations of the jet
morphology from a simple biconical helix.  This is what we attempt to
do in our paper.

In Section 4.1 of the revised manuscript, we mention the quasar 4C
18.68, which is reported to have a helical jet morphology which cannot
be fit by a single biconical helix.  The jet in 4C 18.68 prefers a jet
with a widening opening angle, exactly of the kind we discuss in our
paper.  The morphology of such jets has not been discussed previously
in the literature.  We also feel that it is topical to do so given new
understanding of gas accretion in the GW phase of BH binary evolution.

In Section 4.2 of the revised manuscript, we also discuss how our
chirpy jet morphology could be distinguished from the usual wobbly
jets.

We agree with the referee that this is an important point.  In our
revised manuscript, we now discuss this in detail in Sections 4.1 and
4.2.  Section 4.1 lists angular resolution achievable by current and
upcoming instruments.  It argues that the jet morphology discussed in
this paper should be measurable by these instruments.  In Section 4.2,
we present a detailed algorithm to measure dynamical parameters for an
equal-mass binary BH from the observation of a chirpy jet.

Further, with this reply, we also attach a figure to show how the
geometric model in Section 4.2 works in practice, by fitting it to a
mock data using MCMC.  The MCMC procedure has an added benefit: it
shows that there are no degeneracies in the seven-parameter geometric
model.  The figure shows marginalised posterior distributions of the
parameters of our 7-parameter model when it is fit to mock data.
(These mock data are from the model and then smoothing the resultant
jet morphology, in this case, by ~ 2 mas.)  Wide, uniform priors were
chosen for all parameters.  The posteriors clearly show that there is
no degeneracy in the geometric model.  In fact, the very narrow ranges
of values for which the posteriors are non-zero for each parameter
show that the model fits the mock data very well.  

A second figure attached with this reply shows the jet morphology of
Figure 4 of the paper when smoothed with a 2 mas Gaussian PSF.  The
intensity on this plot is cumulative and the axes show pixel numbers.
The plot shows that it should be possible to see such jets at 2 mas
resolution.  In the paper, we also highlight the case of 4C 18.68, as
mentioned above.

We have now added this reference.

We have now removed this citation.

We had included this figure for pedagogical reasons, but have now removed it.

We had mentioned the first of these points in the caption to Figure 2.
But now we also emphasise both points in the discussion of Equation (7).

We are using S_r \protpto \tau^{-1} and have now corrected the typo in
Equation (17).  We thank the referee for pointing this out and
apologise for the error.

Figure 5 is now Figure 4.

The left panel of this figure shows the position of many particles
observed at a fixed time on Earth.  This partly explains the apparant
change in the jet precession axis in the forward jet: the binary has
evolved between when the outmost particles on this plot were eject and
when the innermost ones were ejected.

Likewise, the right panel of the figure shows the intensity of many
particles at a fixed time on Earth.  Particles that were ejected
earliest have minimum intensity.  The intensity in what is now Figure
5 is cumulative brightness at each point (calculated by assuming that
each jet particle is optically thin).

We have now clarified this in the figure's caption.

We have now clarified this terminology.  By "asymmetric shape", we
meant an apparant variation in the jet precession axis towards the
central source. (This is what we referred to as the "twist" in the jet
morphology in other parts of the manuscript.)

At these separations we would still have t_relativistic_precession <
t_GW < t_orb.  So the three morphological featurs discussed in our
paper would likely persist but there were be an additional component
to the opening angle \psi.  This enhancement in the opening angle will
also result in an enhancement in the spacing between different cycles
of the jet because of enhanced apparant superluminal velocity effect.
We have now highlighted in the text that we have ignored this effect
in our model.  We thank the referee for raising this point.

Farris et al. 2015 have considered both these effects.  We have now
also cited two previous papers by Farris et al. on accretion in BH
binaries elsewhere in the text.

Done. Thanks.

Done.

By "twist" we mean an apparant variation in the jet precession axis
towards the central source.  We have now clarified this in Section 4.
